What datasets are used to detect hate speech in online social media? (From page(s) 1),"Training datasets Page 3: 6329in HateGAN guides the text generation process, which creates diverse and relevant short hate speeches.The generated hate speeches are subsequently used for data augmentation to improve automatic hatespeech detection.There are very few works that explored data augmentation in hate speech detection. In a recent work,Rizos et al. (2019) explored three kinds of data augmentation for hate speech detection. The generated hate speeches are subsequently used for data augmentation to improve automatic hatespeech detection. There are very few works that explored data augmentation in hate speech detection.

What is the i-th search result for a reward vector for sequence? (From page(s) 5),"w1,w2, ,wt1. The average rewards from these N sentences will be utilizedas the reward for the action reward at time step t. We also noted that for the final word prediction, theMC search is not applied. Instead, we feed the whole generated sentence directly to the scoring module.3https://www.perspectiveapi.com/ the model givesdiscrete output, making it hard for gradients to backpropagate. Every token also matters in generat-ing a sequence, and it is meaningless to feed only partially generated sequences to the discriminator.The HateGAN model adopted the sequence generation framework proposed in (Yu et al"

What is the result of the data augmentation from CNN-LSTM-GenAug and CNN-LSTM-ThreshAug? (From page(s) 7),"CNN-LSTM-GenAug is a substitution-based augmentation methodwherean LSTM model is trained to predict the next word based on previous states of the LSTM. We can re-gard it as the first stage of our generative model, which does not have the process of adversarial trainingand reinforcement learning. The CNN-LSTM-ThreshAug trains a sequence generation model wherean LSTM model is trained to predict the next word based on previous states of the LSTM. We can re-gard it as the first stage of our generative model, which does not have the process of adversarial trainingand reinforcement learning."
