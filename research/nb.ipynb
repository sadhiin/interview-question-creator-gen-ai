       " Document(metadata={'source': './data/python-1.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content='Chapter 1\\nThe way of the program\\nThe goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of think-\\ning combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science.\\nLike mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (speciﬁ-\\ncally computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into sys-\\ntems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behav-\\nior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.\\nThe single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem solving . Problem solv-\\ning means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express\\na solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an\\nexcellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That’s why this chapter is called,\\n“The way of the program”.\\nOn one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you\\nwill use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer.\\n1.1 What is a program?\\nAprogram is a sequence of instructions that speciﬁes how to perform a computation. The\\ncomputation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or\\nﬁnding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such as search-\\ning and replacing text in a document or something graphical, like processing an image or\\nplaying a video.\\nThe details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just\\nabout every language:\\ninput: Get data from the keyboard, a ﬁle, the network, or some other device.\\noutput: Display data on the screen, save it in a ﬁle, send it over the network, etc.\\nmath: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.\\nconditional execution: Check for certain conditions and run the appropriate code.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './data/python-1.pdf', 'page': 23}, page_content='2 Chapter 1. The way of the program\\nrepetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.\\nBelieve it or not, that’s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you’ve ever used,\\nno matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look pretty much like these.\\nSo you can think of programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task into\\nsmaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with\\none of these basic instructions.\\n1.2 Running Python\\nOne of the challenges of getting started with Python is that you might have to install\\nPython and related software on your computer. If you are familiar with your operating\\nsystem, and especially if you are comfortable with the command-line interface, you will\\nhave no trouble installing Python. But for beginners, it can be painful to learn about sys-\\ntem administration and programming at the same time.\\nTo avoid that problem, I recommend that you start out running Python in a browser. Later,\\nwhen you are comfortable with Python, I’ll make suggestions for installing Python on your\\ncomputer.\\nThere are a number of web pages you can use to run Python. If you already have a fa-\\nvorite, go ahead and use it. Otherwise I recommend PythonAnywhere. I provide detailed\\ninstructions for getting started at http://tinyurl.com/thinkpython2e .\\nThere are two versions of Python, called Python 2 and Python 3. They are very similar, so\\nif you learn one, it is easy to switch to the other. In fact, there are only a few differences you\\nwill encounter as a beginner. This book is written for Python 3, but I include some notes\\nabout Python 2.\\nThe Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code. Depending\\non your environment, you might start the interpreter by clicking on an icon, or by typing\\npython on a command line. When it starts, you should see output like this:\\nPython 3.4.0 (default, Jun 19 2015, 14:20:21)\\n[GCC 4.8.2] on linux\\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\\n>>>\\nThe ﬁrst three lines contain information about the interpreter and the operating system it’s\\nrunning on, so it might be different for you. But you should check that the version number,\\nwhich is 3.4.0 in this example, begins with 3, which indicates that you are running Python\\n3. If it begins with 2, you are running (you guessed it) Python 2.\\nThe last line is a prompt that indicates that the interpreter is ready for you to enter code. If\\nyou type a line of code and hit Enter, the interpreter displays the result:\\n>>> 1 + 1\\n2\\nNow you’re ready to get started. From here on, I assume that you know how to start the\\nPython interpreter and run code.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './data/python-1.pdf', 'page': 24}, page_content=\"1.3. The ﬁrst program 3\\n1.3 The ﬁrst program\\nTraditionally, the ﬁrst program you write in a new language is called “Hello, World!” be-\\ncause all it does is display the words “Hello, World!”. In Python, it looks like this:\\n>>> print( 'Hello, World! ')\\nThis is an example of a print statement , although it doesn’t actually print anything on\\npaper. It displays a result on the screen. In this case, the result is the words\\nHello, World!\\nThe quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end of the text to be dis-\\nplayed; they don’t appear in the result.\\nThe parentheses indicate that print is a function. We’ll get to functions in Chapter 3.\\nIn Python 2, the print statement is slightly different; it is not a function, so it doesn’t use\\nparentheses.\\n>>> print 'Hello, World! '\\nThis distinction will make more sense soon, but that’s enough to get started.\\n1.4 Arithmetic operators\\nAfter “Hello, World”, the next step is arithmetic. Python provides operators , which are\\nspecial symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication.\\nThe operators +,-, and *perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication, as in the fol-\\nlowing examples:\\n>>> 40 + 2\\n42\\n>>> 43 - 1\\n42\\n>>> 6 * 7\\n42\\nThe operator /performs division:\\n>>> 84 / 2\\n42.0\\nYou might wonder why the result is 42.0 instead of 42. I’ll explain in the next section.\\nFinally, the operator **performs exponentiation; that is, it raises a number to a power:\\n>>> 6**2 + 6\\n42\\nIn some other languages, ^is used for exponentiation, but in Python it is a bitwise operator\\ncalled XOR. If you are not familiar with bitwise operators, the result will surprise you:\\n>>> 6 ^ 2\\n4\\nI won’t cover bitwise operators in this book, but you can read about them at http://wiki.\\npython.org/moin/BitwiseOperators .\")]"

      "The strange history of this book\n",
      "In January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming class in Java. I had\n",
      "taught it three times and I was getting frustrated. The failure rate in the class was too high\n",
      "and, even for students who succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.\n",
      "One of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too much unnecessary\n",
      "detail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance about how to program. And they all\n",
      "suffered from the trap door effect: they would start out easy, proceed gradually, and then\n",
      "somewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would fall out. The students would get too much\n",
      "new material, too fast, and I would spend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces.\n",
      "Two weeks before the ﬁrst day of classes, I decided to write my own book. My goals were:\n",
      "• Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not read 50 pages.\n",
      "• Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize jargon and deﬁne each term at ﬁrst\n",
      "use.\n",
      "• Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difﬁcult topics and split them\n",
      "into a series of small steps.\n",
      "• Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the minimum\n",
      "useful subset of Java and left out the rest.\n",
      "I needed a title, so on a whim I chose How to Think Like a Computer Scientist .\n",
      "My ﬁrst version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading, and they understood\n",
      "enough that I could spend class time on the hard topics, the interesting topics and (most\n",
      "important) letting the students practice.\n",
      "I released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License, which allows users to\n",
      "copy, modify, and distribute the book.\n",
      "What happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school teacher in Virginia, adopted\n",
      "my book and translated it into Python. He sent me a copy of his translation, and I had the\n",
      "unusual experience of learning Python by reading my own book. As Green Tea Press, I\n",
      "published the ﬁrst Python version in 2001.\n",
      "In 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach Python for the ﬁrst time. The\n",
      "contrast with Java was striking. Students struggled less, learned more, worked on more\n",
      "interesting projects, and generally had a lot more fun.vi Chapter 0. Preface\n",
      "Since then I’ve continued to develop the book, correcting errors, improving some of the\n",

      "The result is this book, now with the less grandiose title Think Python . Some of the changes\n",

      "1.2 Running Python\n",
      "One of the challenges of getting started with Python is that you might have to install\n",

      "system, and especially if you are comfortable with the command-line interface, you will\n",
      "have no trouble installing Python. But for beginners, it can be painful to learn about sys-\n",

      "To avoid that problem, I recommend that you start out running Python in a browser. Later,\n",
      "when you are comfortable with Python, I’ll make suggestions for installing Python on your\n",
      "computer.\n",
      "There are a number of web pages you can use to run Python. If you already have a fa-\n",

      "There are two versions of Python, called Python 2 and Python 3. They are very similar, so\n",
      "if you learn one, it is easy to switch to the other. In fact, there are only a few differences you\n",

      "about Python 2.\n",
      "The Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code. Depending\n",
      "on your environment, you might start the interpreter by clicking on an icon, or by typing\n",

      "running on, so it might be different for you. But you should check that the version number,\n",

      "evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated ﬁrst,\n",
      "2 * (3-1) is 4, and (1+1)**(5-2) is 8. You can also use parentheses to make an\n",
      "expression easier to read, as in (minute * 100) / 60 , even if it doesn’t change the\n",
      "result.\n",
      "•Exponentiation has the next highest precedence, so 1 + 2**3 is 9, not 27, and 2 *\n",
      "3**2 is 18, not 36.\n",
      "•Multiplication and Division have higher precedence than Addition and Subtraction.\n",
      "So2*3-1 is 5, not 4, and 6+4/2 is 8, not 5.\n",
      "• Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right (except exponen-\n",
      "tiation). So in the expression degrees / 2 * pi , the division happens ﬁrst and the\n",
      "result is multiplied by pi. To divide by 2 π, you can use parentheses or write degrees\n",
      "/ 2 / pi .\n",
      "I don’t work very hard to remember the precedence of operators. If I can’t tell by looking\n",

      "But there are two exceptions, +and*.\n",

      ">>> first = 'throat '\n",
      ">>> second = 'warbler '\n",
      ">>> first + second\n",
      "throatwarbler\n",
      "The *operator also works on strings; it performs repetition. For example, 'Spam '*3is\n",
      "'SpamSpamSpam '. If one of the values is a string, the other has to be an integer.\n",
      "This use of +and *makes sense by analogy with addition and multiplication. Just as 4*3\n",
      "is equivalent to 4+4+4 , we expect 'Spam '*3to be the same as 'Spam '+'Spam '+'Spam ', and\n",

      "• Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements,\n",
      "which makes your program easier to read and debug.\n",
      "• Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you\n",
      "make a change, you only have to make it in one place.\n",
      "• Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time\n",
      "and then assemble them into a working whole.\n",
      "• Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and\n",

      "3.12 Debugging\n",
      "One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging. Although it can be frus-\n",

      "of programming.\n",
      "In some ways debugging is like detective work. You are confronted with clues and you\n",
      "have to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see.\n",
      "Debugging is also like an experimental science. Once you have an idea about what is going\n",
      "wrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis was correct, you can\n",
      "predict the result of the modiﬁcation, and you take a step closer to a working program. If\n",
      "your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one. As Sherlock Holmes\n",
      "pointed out, “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however im-\n",
      "probable, must be the truth.” (A. Conan Doyle, The Sign of Four )\n",
      "For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That is, programming\n",

      "implementation of a map and gradually improve it until it’s a hashtable.\n",
      "I use Python to demonstrate these implementations, but in real life you wouldn’t write\n",
      "code like this in Python; you would just use a dictionary! So for the rest of this chapter, you\n",
      "have to imagine that dictionaries don’t exist and you want to implement a data structure\n",
      "that maps from keys to values. The operations you have to implement are:\n",
      "add(k, v) :Add a new item that maps from key kto value v. With a Python dictionary, d,\n",
      "this operation is written d[k] = v .\n",
      "get(k) :Look up and return the value that corresponds to key k. With a Python dictionary,\n",
      "d, this operation is written d[k] ord.get(k) .\n",
      "For now, I assume that each key only appears once. The simplest implementation of this\n",

      "Question:  1. Explain the concept of algorithm analysis in computer science and its importance. Provide a scenario where algorithm analysis played a crucial role in decision-making.\n",
      "Answer:  Algorithm analysis in computer science is a field that focuses on studying the performance of algorithms, especially their runtime and space requirements. The goal of algorithm analysis is to predict how different algorithms will perform in order to guide design decisions. It helps in understanding the efficiency of algorithms and making informed choices about which algorithm to use based on the problem at hand.\n",

      "An example of algorithm analysis playing a crucial role in decision-making is in the selection of sorting algorithms. During the 2008 United States Presidential Campaign, candidate Barack Obama was asked to provide the most efficient way to sort a million 32-bit integers during a visit to Google. This scenario highlighted the importance of understanding algorithm efficiency in real-world applications. Obama quickly recognized that the bubble sort algorithm would be slow for large datasets and suggested using radix sort instead, showcasing the significance of algorithm analysis in making informed decisions about algorithm selection.\n",

      "Question:  3. How does encoding ranks and suits in a standard playing card object representation aid in comparing cards based on their attributes? Illustrate the implementation of encoding in a Card class using named tuples and inheritance in object-oriented programming.\n",
      "Answer:  Encoding ranks and suits in a standard playing card object representation aids in comparing cards based on their attributes by providing a standardized way to represent ranks and suits as integers. This allows for easier comparison of cards based on their attributes, such as rank and suit, without needing to deal with string comparisons.\n",
